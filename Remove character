Given two strings string1 and string2, remove those characters from first string(string1) which are present in second string(string2). Both the strings are different and contain only lowercase characters.
NOTE: Size of  first string is always greater than the size of  second string( |string1| > |string2|).
 

Example 1:

Input:
string1 = "computer"
string2 = "cat"
Output: "ompuer"
Explanation: After removing characters(c, a, t)
from string1 we get "ompuer".

Example 2:

Input:
string1 = "occurrence"
string2 = "car"
Output: "ouene"
Explanation: After removing characters
(c, a, r) from string1 we get "ouene".

Code Solution:-

class Solution:
    def removeChars (ob, string1, string2):
        # code here 
        l = list(string1)
        for i in string2:
            if (i in l):
                ct=l.count(i)
                for _ in range(ct):
                    l.remove(i)
        return (''.join(l))
